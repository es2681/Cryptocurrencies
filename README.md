# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize unsupervised machine learning techniques to process and group cryptocurrencies to spot trends for potential investment opportunities. 

## Results
Please refer to the crypto_clustering.ipynb document for details of the analysis. 

In Deliverable 1, the data was cleaned, processed, and scaled to prepare it for unsupervised machine learning. Following, a Principal Component (PCA) algorithm was used to reduce the dimensions of the DataFrame to three principal components in a new DataFrame for Deliverable 2. In Deliverable 3, the K-Means algorithm and hvPlot were used to create an elbow curve to determine the best K-value for the DataFrame and to predict the best number of K clusters for the crytpocurrency data. Finally, in Deliverable 4, 


### Deliverable 3: Elbow Curve
The elbow curve diagram appears to indicate that 4 clusters are appropriate for clustering the cryptocurrency data
